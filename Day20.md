Today was presentation day for the class. We got a bug the first run-through,
which really stressed us all out but it worked out in the end. Everyone seemed
to really like our project, and Chai, Cam and I are going to keep working on it
over the break. Esther would like to but she's starting a new job, so we're just going to keep here in the loop. I have a list of things we can do to improve it, and everyone seems
pumped to keep working on it. I had the best group, hands down. We had a wide range of strengths, and everyone got along. I think I was the pissiest person on the team, but even I wasn't too bad.
