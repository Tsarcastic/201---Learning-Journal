<h1>LJ Code 301 - Day 1</h1>

<p>Today seemed to be mostly a review of the previous session, with some discussion and demonstrations about making a responsive website. I'm concerned about this week because I can't seem to grok HTML/CSS so adding layers on that might just slow me down. I'm really looking forward to Javascript/jQuery, tho. That side to coding is what I'm really passionate about.</p>
