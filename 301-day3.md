<h1>301 - Day 3</h1>

This class was confusing. Around three o clock I completely lost track of what was happening and couldn't catch up. I understand the basics of jQuery but we rushed through functions I was having trouble with, and it happened enough times that I couldn't hold on to the vagueish understanding I had of any of them. I am concerned that I understand the larger concepts, and the idea of selectors & jQuery methods but have trouble putting it into practice during the assignments. I'm looking forward to whatever topic we cover next.
