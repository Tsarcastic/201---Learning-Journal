<h1>Day 8</h1>
This continues to be a rough class. I don't feel suited to this kind of learning or subject and I feel like I'm falling behind. SQL makes a lot of sense to me, and as an Excel nerd I'm super excited to learn the more advanced functions. However I thought we were going to go over SQL in class but it seems like we learned how to integrate it into Javascript instead. And I don't quite understand that, though I understand I'm not exactly meant to at this point. I'm also falling very behind with my portfolio, which I'm sure isn't helping my sense of falling behind.
