Today was a difficult day. We went into more stuff with templating and object literals. I understand the idea behind both of them, but I have a lot of difficulty executing the actual problems. I'm better with templates and can pull them off but I still don't feel that I actually grasp them, just that I'm faking understanding pretty well.
