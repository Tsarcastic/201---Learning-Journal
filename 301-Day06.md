<h1>301 - Day 06</h1>

The first part of class today was spent discussing the class itself, which seemed necessary but didn't advance our information much.

After that we spent a lot of time covering AJAX & JSON. These seem like pretty cool concepts, although I'm concerned I'm not fully grasping things. It seems relatively simple, and I feel like I understand it, but that makes me worried even more than complete confusion. I continue to fall behind on my journal because of a lack of available time, so I guess I'm just going to have to work on that on a weekend this month. Based on the MVP conditions for earlier assignments I think I should be able to incorporate changes pretty fast and painlessly.
