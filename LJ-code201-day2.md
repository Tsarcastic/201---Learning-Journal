Learning Journal - Day 2

My Dear Martha,

The **Coding War** still rages on around me. Git has arrived on our shores and I worry we may remain stuck in the trenches tending to our wounded. I've learned the basic processees by which it functions, and I know I always need to add, commit then push. For now.

I made some progress on my About Me project, but not being able to use functions was frustrating. I couldn't figure out how to set up an else/if statement to handle an OR statement so I had to set up a line for "yes" and a line for "y." Same with the negatives.

I'm also worried my gitbash console isn't set up properly. I can't seem to copy/paste items into the terminal, and whenever I open a document with atom the terminal seems to freeze until I close out of that instance of Atom. And if I close the console with that Atom doc still open it will close with Git Bash.
