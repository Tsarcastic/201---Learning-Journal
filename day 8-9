In the past two days we've focused the vast majority of our attention on
creating a table with javascript, and creating a form in the HTML where the user can
fill out their info, press a button, and have their information converted into the table
format and have it appended to the main table.

I really like the Javascript portion. This is getting very tricky with a variety of methods
to achieve any end result. We've also learned about some HTML and CSS components, as a by-product
of this. And the weekly project (make a small business website with internal and external facing)
portions. Unsurprisingly I'm loving the internal facing component of it, but the HTML and CSS
just drains me. And I don't have good work to show for it, which compounds the frustration.
