</h1>Day 10</h1>

Friday was the first day in a while that made me feel I understood what was happening. Going back to javascript methods is challenging but good. Over the weekend I also worked on my portfolio and caught up on a few days, which helped me feel a little less overwhelmed. Only one week of class left but hopefully we'll cover a little less ground and re-focus on solidifying our knowledge.
